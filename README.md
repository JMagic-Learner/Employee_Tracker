## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Employee_Tracker.
              
Description:
This application mimics a employee directory for the SCP Foundation. The database contains a department table, a employee table, and a role table. The department table describes the various divisions within the SCP foundation. Employees table shows the numerical ID, names, roles, salaries, and statuses of SCP personnel. Finnally, roles show the department delegation attributed to each employee.             
          
Coding Process
"Lots of trial and error". This project was confusing becuase of the PRIMARY key + FORIEGN key constraints. At some point I couldn't tell if I was doing the relationships wrong or if the keys were referencing the wrong thing. I took a look at the README for this homework and realizeed that my database structure was wrong. I made the mistake of constructing the DB from scratch before reading the PRIMARY and FORIEGN relationships.

Step 1.) Clone this repository.,
Step 2.) NPM i to install predetermined node packages.,
Step 3.) Replace the password in server.js with your own MySql password.,
Step 4.) Navigate to the DB folder, and install/run schema.sql via terminal,
Step 5.) In that same folder, install/run seed.sql via SOURCE seed.sql,
Step 6.) Open up server.js in bash terminal, use node server.js to run the inquirer prompts,
Step 7.) Close out the program and restart whenever you finish a prompt path. I know, I need to work on recycling through.
             
                     
# Usage
